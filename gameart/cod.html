					<p>Before I begin I want to point out that I am not particularly good at ghosts, and that I don't think I can help anyone improve their gun skill. However, I watch a lot of people play, whether it's whilst I'm dead in SnD or just things I notice during the game, and the number of silly mistakes that people make so consistently is infuriating. Therefore I have compiled a list of the top 5 most annoying things I see people do whilst playing CoD.Not playing the clock in SnD. When you have the bomb down or are on defense and you know where the opposing player(s) are then there is no need to play recklessly. This seems obvious to many of you, but a lot of people still do it.This point is similar to the first one, but people challenge things consistently when the chance of them winning the gunfight isn't at least 50:50. When people challenge a stupid gunfight they have very little chance to win, instantly your team is in a 3v4 situation for 5 seconds. It is always worth staying alive and waiting for help from a teammate or trying to get yourself into a more beneficial position to challenge.Count kills. Make sure someone on your team can keep track of who's alive and who's been killed recently on the other team, you shouldn't ever give up more than 1 or 2 sneak caps in Blitz. At the same time, you shouldn't give up map control to try and find one person, because often you can take your momentum forward and get multiple caps at the cost of one.Get annoyed quietly. It's too much to ask most people on Ghosts not to get annoyed. The problem is when people get annoyed before calling out useful information. This is especially important in SnD. On a side note, in SnD don't talk when teammates are trying to clutch, and only call stuff out if you're sure. Also don't tell your teammate how to play a 1vX situation, because undoubtedly they will want to play to their strengths, not yours.Finally, and probably the thing that annoys me the most, is that people are rarely positive to their teammates, and are too quick to point the finger. Little things in-gameÂ like saying "good kill" and "nice shot" are enough to boost people's confidence and get them more focused.</p>
